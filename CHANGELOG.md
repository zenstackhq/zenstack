# 0.4.0 (2022-12-01)

### Features

-   `zenstack init` command for initializing a project, [#109](https://github.com/zenstackhq/zenstack/issues/109), [doc](https://zenstack.dev/#/quick-start?id=adding-to-an-existing-project).

-   Options for disabling fetching in hooks (useful when arguments are not ready), [#57](https://github.com/zenstackhq/zenstack/issues/57), [doc](https://zenstack.dev/#/runtime-api?id=requestoptions).

### Fixes and improvements

-   Merge `@zenstackhq/internal` into `@zenstackhq/runtime` so as to have a single runtime dependency, [#70](https://github.com/zenstackhq/zenstack/issues/70).

-   More accurate log for access policy violation, [#71](https://github.com/zenstackhq/zenstack/issues/71).

-   `auth()` function's return type is now resolved to `User` model in ZModel, instead of `Any`, [#65](https://github.com/zenstackhq/zenstack/issues/65).

-   Improved ZModel type checking, [#67](https://github.com/zenstackhq/zenstack/issues/67), [#46](https://github.com/zenstackhq/zenstack/issues/46), [#99](https://github.com/zenstackhq/zenstack/issues/99).

-   Upgraded to Prisma 4.7.

### Breaking changes

-   @zenstackhq/runtime doesn't export anything now.

    Use @zenstackhq/runtime/types for type definitions shared between client and server, @zenstackhq/runtime/client for client-specific libaries (like React hooks), and @zenstackhq/runtime/server for server-specific libraries.
