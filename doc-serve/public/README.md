# ZenStack

> A toolkit for building secure CRUD apps with Next.js.

## What it is

ZenStack is a schema-first toolkit for defining data models, relations and access policies. It generates database schema, backend CRUD services and frontend React hooks for you automatically from the model. Our goal is to let you save time writing boilerplate code and focus on building real features!

_NOTE_: ZenStack is built above [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/) - the greatest ORM solution for Typescript. It extends Prisma's power from database handling to full-stack development.

See the [Quick start](quick-start.md) guide for more details.

## Features

-   Intuitive data & authorization modeling language
-   Generating RESTful CRUD services and React hooks
