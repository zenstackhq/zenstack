## What is ZenStack?

ZenStack is a toolkit for simplifying full-stack development with Node.js web frameworks like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Coming%20Soon-lightgray" height="12" align="top"> and [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Coming%20Soon-lightgray" height="12" align="top">, using Typescript language.

With the increasing power of such frameworks, it's becoming more and more practical to build a complex web app all within one unified framework. However, you'll still need to spend significantly amout of engergy to design and build up the backend part of your app.

Things to consider inlcude:

-   What kind of API to use? RESTful or GraphQL?
-   How to model your data and map the model to both source code and database (ORM)?
-   How to implement common CRUD operations? Manually construct it or use a generator?
-   How to evolve your data model?
-   How to authenticate users and authorize their requests?

ZenStack aims to simplify these tasks by providing an intuitive data modeling language to define data types and access policies, integrated with user authentication. It generates RESTful services as well as a client-side library, allowing flexible and painless CRUD operations. Typescript types are generated for data models, CRUD input, filters, etc., so that you get great coding experiences in IDE and have much fewer chances to make mistakes.

ZenStack is both heavily inspired and built above [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/), which is in our oppinion the best ORM toolkit in the market. Familarity with Prisma should make it very easy to pick up ZenStack, but it's not prerequisite since the modeling language is intuitive and the development workflow is straightforward.

## Getting started

### With Next.js

The easiest way to start using ZenStack is by creating a new Next.js project from a preconfigured template.

1. Make sure you have Node.js 16 or above and NPM 6 or above installed
1.
